<objective>
Wire the multi-stage quality pipeline: curated feeds as primary content (no ML gating), GDELT positive-tone articles as ML-sentiment-filtered supplement, merged into a unified feed rendered by PositiveNewsFeedPanel. Also wire auto-refresh and the panel into App.ts.

Purpose: This completes the Phase 3 feature set by connecting all the pieces -- the panel (Plan 02), the App.ts integration (Plan 01), the existing ML worker, the existing GDELT positive fetcher, and the existing curated RSS feeds -- into a cohesive pipeline that prioritizes curated content and supplements it with ML-verified mainstream news.

Output: A complete, working positive news experience on the happy variant with auto-refresh and multi-stage quality pipeline.

  <name>Task 1: Create sentiment gate service for ML-based filtering</name>
  <files>src/services/sentiment-gate.ts</files>
  <action>
Create a new service module `src/services/sentiment-gate.ts` that wraps the existing `mlWorker.classifySentiment()` for filtering news items by positive sentiment.

**Exports:**

```typescript
import { mlWorker } from './ml-worker';
import type { NewsItem } from '@/types';

const DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.85;
const BATCH_SIZE = 20; // ML_THRESHOLDS.maxTextsPerBatch from ml-config.ts

/**
 * Filter news items by positive sentiment using DistilBERT-SST2.
 * Returns only items classified as positive with score >= threshold.
 *
 * Graceful degradation:
 * - If mlWorker is not ready/available, returns all items unfiltered
 * - If classification fails, returns all items unfiltered
 * - Batches titles to respect ML worker limits
 *
 * @param items - News items to filter
 * @param threshold - Minimum positive confidence score (default 0.85)
 * @returns Items passing the sentiment filter
 */
export async function filterBySentiment(
  items: NewsItem[],
  threshold = DEFAULT_THRESHOLD
): Promise<NewsItem[]> {
  if (items.length === 0) return [];

  // Check localStorage override for threshold tuning during development
  try {
    const override = localStorage.getItem('positive-threshold');
    if (override) {
      const parsed = parseFloat(override);
      if (!isNaN(parsed) && parsed >= 0 && parsed <= 1) {
        threshold = parsed;
        console.log(`[SentimentGate] Using override threshold: ${threshold}`);
      }
    }
  } catch { /* ignore localStorage errors */ }

  // Graceful degradation: if ML not available, pass all items through
  try {
    const ready = await mlWorker.init();
    if (!ready) {
      console.log('[SentimentGate] ML worker not available, passing all items through');
      return items;
    }
  } catch {
    console.log('[SentimentGate] ML worker init failed, passing all items through');
    return items;
  }

  try {
    const titles = items.map(item => item.title);
    const allResults: Array<{ label: string; score: number }> = [];

    // Batch to avoid overwhelming the worker
    for (let i = 0; i < titles.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
      const batch = titles.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
      const batchResults = await mlWorker.classifySentiment(batch);
      allResults.push(...batchResults);
    }

    const passed = items.filter((_, idx) => {
      const result = allResults[idx];
      return result && result.label === 'positive' && result.score >= threshold;
    });

    console.log(`[SentimentGate] ${passed.length}/${items.length} items passed (threshold=${threshold})`);
    return passed;
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn('[SentimentGate] Sentiment classification failed, passing all items through:', err);
    return items;
  }
}
```

**Key design decisions per research:**
- `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.85` -- hypothesis from STATE.md. Tunable via localStorage `positive-threshold` key for experimentation.
- Graceful degradation at every level: worker not ready, init fails, classification fails -- always returns items rather than empty array.
- Batches at 20 items per call (matches ML_THRESHOLDS.maxTextsPerBatch).
- Logging pass rate to console for threshold tuning during development.
- Uses `mlWorker.init()` which is idempotent -- safe to call even if already initialized.

  <done>
Sentiment gate service exports `filterBySentiment(items, threshold?)` that batches titles through DistilBERT-SST2, returns only positive items above threshold, and degrades gracefully when ML is unavailable.

  <name>Task 2: Wire PositiveNewsFeedPanel and multi-stage pipeline into App.ts</name>
  <files>src/App.ts</files>
  <action>
This task wires everything together in App.ts. Plan 01 already added happy variant guards. Now we add the PositiveNewsFeedPanel instantiation and the multi-stage news loading pipeline.

**Step 1: Add imports at top of App.ts**

Add these imports (alongside existing imports):
```typescript
import { PositiveNewsFeedPanel } from '@/components/PositiveNewsFeedPanel';
import { filterBySentiment } from '@/services/sentiment-gate';
import { fetchAllPositiveTopicIntelligence } from '@/services/gdelt-intel';
```

Note: `fetchAllPositiveTopicIntelligence` might already be imported from Phase 2 -- check and only add if missing. Same for `classifyNewsItem` (already imported from 02-03).

**Step 2: Add positivePanel property**

Add to the class properties (near the other panel declarations):
```typescript
private positivePanel: PositiveNewsFeedPanel | null = null;
```

**Step 3: Create PositiveNewsFeedPanel in createPanels()**

In the `createPanels()` method, add happy variant panel creation. Place this in the happy-specific section (Plan 01 added conditional blocks). When `SITE_VARIANT === 'happy'`:

```typescript
if (SITE_VARIANT === 'happy') {
  this.positivePanel = new PositiveNewsFeedPanel();
  this.panels['positive-feed'] = this.positivePanel;
}
```

The PositiveNewsFeedPanel will be positioned by the panel ordering system. Add 'positive-feed' to the HAPPY_PANELS config if not already present (it should replace or supplement the dynamic FEEDS-based news panels for happy variant).

Actually, looking at HAPPY_PANELS in happy.ts, the 'live-news' panel slot can be reused for 'positive-feed' since Plan 01 removes live-news for happy. But the panel ordering comes from `DEFAULT_PANELS` keys. We should add 'positive-feed' to HAPPY_PANELS or adjust ordering.

**Simplest approach:** Add 'positive-feed' to HAPPY_PANELS in `src/config/variants/happy.ts`:
```typescript
'positive-feed': { name: 'Good News Feed', enabled: true, priority: 1 },
```
Replace the 'live-news' entry. This way the panel ordering system picks it up automatically. BUT -- this file isn't in our files_modified list. Instead, handle it in createPanels(): after creating PositiveNewsFeedPanel, make sure it gets added to panelsGrid via the ordering loop. The existing dynamic FEEDS loop already creates per-category NewsPanels. For happy, we want BOTH: the PositiveNewsFeedPanel (unified view) AND the per-category panels (for panel-specific browsing).

Wait -- re-reading the research recommendation: "Build a dedicated PositiveNewsFeedPanel" to replace the separate per-category panels. The PositiveNewsFeedPanel IS the unified view with filtering. The per-category dynamic NewsPanels are redundant when we have the filter bar.

**Revised approach:** For happy variant, create PositiveNewsFeedPanel as the FIRST panel (replacing live-news position). The dynamic FEEDS loop will still create per-category NewsPanels (positive, science, nature, health, inspiring) -- those are fine to keep as additional browsing options. The PositiveNewsFeedPanel aggregates all categories with filtering.

Concretely:
1. Create PositiveNewsFeedPanel in createPanels() for happy variant
2. In the panel ordering section, if happy variant, put 'positive-feed' first (where live-news would have been)

**Step 4: Wire loadNews() happy branch for multi-stage pipeline**

In the `loadNews()` method (or `loadNewsCategory()` -- whichever handles the FEEDS-based loading), add a happy-specific branch that runs after all category feeds are loaded. The existing flow already:
1. Iterates through FEEDS categories
2. Calls fetchCategoryFeeds for each
3. Tags items with happyCategory (from 02-03)

After all categories finish loading, aggregate items and send to PositiveNewsFeedPanel. Add a new method `loadHappyNewsPipeline()` that:

```typescript
private async loadHappyNewsPipeline(): Promise<void> {
  if (SITE_VARIANT !== 'happy' || !this.positivePanel) return;

  // Stage 1: Collect all curated items from loaded news panels
  // The per-category NewsPanels already have their items from loadNews()
  const curatedItems: NewsItem[] = [];
  for (const [key, panel] of Object.entries(this.newsPanels)) {
    // Get items from panel (need access to rendered items)
    // Actually, items are stored in loadNewsCategory's closure -- need a different approach
  }
```

Hmm, the items aren't stored on the panel. Let me reconsider the architecture.

**Better approach:** Store happy variant items at the App level during loadNewsCategory():

Add a class property: `private happyAllItems: NewsItem[] = [];`

In `loadNewsCategory()`, after the existing happyCategory tagging block (~line 3384-3388), add:
```typescript
if (SITE_VARIANT === 'happy') {
  // Accumulate items for the unified positive feed panel
  this.happyAllItems = this.happyAllItems.concat(items);
}
```

Then, in `loadNews()`, after all category loads complete, call the pipeline:
```typescript
// After awaiting all category feeds:
if (SITE_VARIANT === 'happy') {
  await this.loadHappySupplementaryAndRender();
}
```

**loadHappySupplementaryAndRender() method:**
```typescript
private async loadHappySupplementaryAndRender(): Promise<void> {
  if (!this.positivePanel) return;

  // Stage 1: Curated items already accumulated in happyAllItems during loadNewsCategory calls
  const curated = [...this.happyAllItems];

  // Stage 2: Load GDELT positive articles as supplementary content (async, non-blocking)
  let supplementary: NewsItem[] = [];
  try {
    const gdeltTopics = await fetchAllPositiveTopicIntelligence();
    const gdeltItems: NewsItem[] = gdeltTopics.flatMap(topic =>
      topic.articles.map(article => ({
        source: 'GDELT',
        title: article.title,
        link: article.url,
        pubDate: new Date(article.seenDate || Date.now()),
        isAlert: false,
        imageUrl: article.imageUrl || undefined,
        happyCategory: classifyNewsItem('GDELT', article.title),
      }))
    );

    // Stage 3: Sentiment-filter GDELT articles
    supplementary = await filterBySentiment(gdeltItems);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn('[App] Happy supplementary pipeline failed, using curated only:', err);
  }

  // Stage 4: Merge with curated first, supplementary after, sorted by date
  const merged = [...curated, ...supplementary];
  merged.sort((a, b) => b.pubDate.getTime() - a.pubDate.getTime());

  // Render unified feed
  this.positivePanel.renderPositiveNews(merged);
}
```

Check the GDELT article shape -- `GdeltArticle` from gdelt-intel.ts has `title`, `url`, `seenDate`, and `socialImage`. Map `socialImage` to `imageUrl`.

**Step 5: Reset happyAllItems at start of loadNews()**

At the beginning of `loadNews()`, add:
```typescript
if (SITE_VARIANT === 'happy') {
  this.happyAllItems = [];
}
```

This ensures each refresh cycle starts fresh.

**Step 6: Ensure auto-refresh works (NEWS-03)**

Plan 01 already set up `this.scheduleRefresh('news', () => this.loadNews(), REFRESH_INTERVALS.feeds)` for happy variant. The `loadNews()` flow now includes the happy pipeline, so auto-refresh automatically triggers the full pipeline on each interval. Filter state in PositiveNewsFeedPanel is preserved because `renderPositiveNews()` calls `applyFilter()` which uses the stored `activeFilter`.

**IMPORTANT:** The `loadHappySupplementaryAndRender()` runs AFTER curated feeds complete, so the panel shows curated content first, then updates with supplementary GDELT content once sentiment filtering completes. This matches the research recommendation of "never block render on ML load."

Actually, for even better UX: render curated items immediately, then append supplementary after ML completes:

```typescript
// Render curated immediately
this.positivePanel.renderPositiveNews(curated);

// Then async load and merge supplementary
try {
  // ... GDELT + sentiment filtering ...
  const merged = [...curated, ...supplementary];
  merged.sort((a, b) => b.pubDate.getTime() - a.pubDate.getTime());
  this.positivePanel.renderPositiveNews(merged);
} catch { /* curated already rendered, supplementary failure is non-fatal */ }
```

This way users see content immediately, and GDELT supplements appear a few seconds later when ML completes.

Happy variant has a complete multi-stage news pipeline: (1) curated RSS feeds load and render immediately in PositiveNewsFeedPanel, (2) GDELT positive articles are fetched and sentiment-filtered asynchronously, (3) supplementary items merge into the feed sorted by date. Auto-refresh on REFRESH_INTERVALS.feeds re-runs the entire pipeline with filter state preserved. ML unavailability degrades gracefully to curated-only display.
